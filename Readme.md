# Database

Database is a way to store data in tabular format. It is efficient and flexible. It ensures that there is no **redundancy** in the data. There are particularly two types of databases.

- Relational Databases (SQLite,MYSQL, PostgreSQL)
- Object Databases (Mongodb)

## Relational Databases

In Relational database data is stored in the form of tables, where each row is called a **record** and a column is called a **Field**.

## SQL

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**. It is a powerful relational database query language. It is not a Case Sensitive Language.

## File Processing System vs Database Systems

In file processing system data is stored in files. Data is interdependent. Which means change in one place cause a change in another place. Hence data is not secure.

## Database Systems

Data in database systems is independent.

**Advantages of Database:**

- Data Sharing
- Data Independence
- Controlled Redundancy
- Better data integrity (valid data)

**This Repository covers MYSQL database.**
